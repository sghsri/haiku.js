# Haiku.js

Sometimes, coding in Javascript can be stressful, we get it. Promises, Prototypes, JSON, who knows what they mean (not us). We here at Haiku.js think we can make it better with some poetry.

Preferably in three lines of five, seven, and five.

## Set Up

Install all of the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then to run the flask services execute

```bash
flask run
```

You may need to edit the base url in `client/scripts/js`

Open up http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your favorite browser to start writing some poetry!
